TODO for 1.0.11:
- evanescent plane wave in python
- field generators ?

TODO 1.1:
- full pyDGM-UI support
- full python GDM implementation



Further TODO:
fixes / tests:
- test properly chirality!!
- multipole development: scattering / extinction


small fixes / improvements:
- autoscaling in `visu.structure`: adapt to screen dpi
- implement more info-printing methods in "simulation" class (field-indices for example)


conversion to pure python:
- LDOS stuff
- evanescent plane wave field generator
- improve field generator API


add:
- "HE" farfield-propagator with substrate (ClÃ©ment?) + add to "farfield"
- "HE", "HH" near-field propagator with substrate


tests:
- unit-test for propagators
- unit-tests for every incident field
- unit-test for "linear" / "nonlinear"
- unit-test for structures (to guarantee reproducibility)
- unit-tests for every material class
- unit-test for tools


long-term improvements:
- fully retarded 1-2-3 propagator?
- implement 6x6 "super-propagator" (--> magnetic fields inside)
- 3-layer asymptotic propagators


documentation:
- doc: example with farfield scattering into substrate
- doc: tutorial turn off interactions between nanostructures
- doc: example optical chirality
- doc: example far-field chirality
- doc: comprehensive explanation of "fieldindex"
- doc: improve "overview"
- doc: add some tutorial on structures (+ example of inconsistent geometry)
- doc: later(?) tutorial anisotropic permittivity (birefringence?)
